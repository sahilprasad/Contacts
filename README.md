# Contacts
Using an address book representation, I parsed input XML data files into parse trees that were then converted into internal data represenations that could be used as a line of communication between the Client and Server classes I had configured. The client could use commands such as "delete" and "add" to make changes to their local version of the address book, and could could use the "push" or "pull" commmands to communicate with the server in a manner similar to many version control systems. 

This project was done for a class at Brown University, and as per policy, the code cannot be made publicly available. For the raw code and/or more information, please contact me at sahil_prasad@brown.edu. Thank you.
